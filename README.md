# Housing-Price-Prediction

A Linear Regression model implemented from scratch in Python to predict housing prices using the California Housing Prices dataset.

## Overview

This project demonstrates a custom implementation of Linear Regression with Gradient Descent, avoiding external machine learning libraries. It processes the California Housing Prices dataset, performs manual feature scaling, and evaluates the model using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Squared Error (MSE).

- **Algorithm**: Linear Regression with Gradient Descent
- **Dataset**: California Housing Prices (from scikit-learn or a local CSV)
- **Language**: Python
- **Features**: Manual feature scaling, no external ML libraries
- **Metrics**: MAE, MSE

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Basic Python libraries (e.g., numpy for numerical operations, if included)
- Git (for cloning the repository)
- The California Housing Prices dataset (included or downloadable from scikit-learn)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/meetpatel3690/Housing-Price-Prediction-Using-LinearRegression.git
